# DeliciousNotes
An iPhone app to help you keep track of restaurants that you liked and ones that you would like to go to.

This app is a work in progress and is being finalized for submission to the App Store. It is also my final project for my iOS Developer Nanodegree.

Delicious Notes is written in Swift 3.

## Install

In order to run this app you will need Xcode 8.2. If using a personal iOS device, it will need to have iOS 10.1 or later installed.

1. Open `DeliciousNotes.xcodeproj` in Xcode

If you built and ran a previous version on this app, you made need to delete the existing app and create a fresh install.
